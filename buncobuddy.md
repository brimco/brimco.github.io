The best way for Bunco enthusiasts to track their score!

In this fast-paced game of dice and numbers, it can be tough to keep everything straight - what numbers you just rolled on the dice, what the adjustment to your score should be, performing the math in your head, and tracking what your new score is - all in a second before you roll those dice again.

The Bunco Buddy app was designed to be your score-tracking buddy amidst this chaos. Simply tap the button for the dice you rolled, and keep on rolling! Bunco Buddy will keep tabs on what your score is while you focus on rolling those dice as fast as you can, taking away the stress of remembering numbers and doing quick math so you can enjoy the game with your friends and family.

Bunco Buddy is free download and use with zero ads or in-app payments!

## Advice
If your teammate is also using this app for a round, it's easiest to track the score on one device. Teammates take turns tracking scores on the designated device while the other teammate rolls the dice. When the round's over, edit the score on the other device.
